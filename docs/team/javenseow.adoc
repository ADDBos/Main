== Overview

AddressBook - Level 4 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to search for residents by room number, school or CCA*
** What it does: allows the user to search for residents based on room numbers, schools or even the CCAs that the residents are in.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user might want to find residents based on certain specifications.
** Highlights: This enhancement required manipulation of existing data fields of the residents since multiple specifications can be used as a search criteria
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: updated the data fields that were required for each resident.
