== Introduction

Hallper is a desktop app for the JCRC that allows *for better and faster management of residents' contacts*. More importantly, Hallper is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Hallper can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `Hallper.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Hallper.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
