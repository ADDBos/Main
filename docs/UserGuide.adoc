== Introduction

Hallper is a desktop app for the JCRC that allows *for better and faster management of residents' contacts*. More importantly, Hallper is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Hallper can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `Hallper.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].

.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Hallper.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the User Guide window.

== Command Examples
Here are some commands that you can try out with:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com r/A110 s/FoS t/basketball` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to Hallper.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
